We will be building n X m tic tae toe, rather than the traditional 3 X 3 tic tae toe.
So we'll need to do something optimal


Different components that we'll need will be:
1. Player: who will be the players to participate (we'll let any number of players to participate rather than traditional number 2)
2. Board:  kind of board we are going to play on (n X n)
3. Move:   Each player will mark their id in the spot they choose to play on, same spot for whole row, col or diagonal wins
4. Game: Once we know the Player and the Board we can host a game using details of Player and Board
